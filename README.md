# LibLynx Wordpress Plugin

This is a simple integration of the LibLynx access management API which allows posts or pages within
Wordpress to have their access controlled by LibLynx. 

This allows content to be easily protected by IP address, username/password, Shibboleth/SAML,
OpenID Connect, SIP2/library cards, and many other authentication mechanisms.

To use this plugin, you require a LibLynx API key - contact support@liblynx.com for assistance.
